# kickstarter-analysis
    Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to identify any success trends pertaining to a launch date for a production in a theater as well as how their financial goals might have played a part in their success.
    How
  The analysis was performed by creating line graphs highlighting the changes in success depending on launch date as well as the financial goal of the production. The only major problem I ran into is that my outcomes vs goals chart did not look like the one in the example but my numbers appear to  be accurate so I believe my chart is accurate as well.    ![Theater Outcomes Vs Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84109986/124372810-40aac480-dc5b-11eb-9faa-001535e33599.png)

    Results
  According to the data on theater outcomes by launch date, it can be concluded that summer productions tend to perform better than any other time of year and winter productions have the least success compared to the rest of the year.
  According to the data, it is clearly shown that the lower the financial goal, the higher rate of successful productions. There is also an obvious negative correlation between success and failed productions.
  The main limitations of this dataset is more specific descriptive data on the plays such as genre of play.
  Another chart that might highlight the failures of some of these productions would be a chart that shows how much money was the goal versus how much was pledged and show a percentage, specifically for failed and canceled productions.
